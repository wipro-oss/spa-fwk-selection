# SPA Framework Selection

A simple tool to help in the selection of a SPA (Single Page Application) framework. There are several parameters each of which has been grouped under a section. The user can adjust the weights for each of the individual parameters which are multiplied with a score. This score is assigned for each of the frameworks by me based on my perception. The weighted scores of the each section are converted to a percentage score. This percentage score is weighted by the section weight which gives the actual score. Four views of these scores are presented to the user to make a choice.
